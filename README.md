# GMTactician Collection: MCTS Tree Devkit

## Introduction

This library provides a basic framework for implementing the [Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) (MCTS) algorithm. Both synchronous and asynchronous evaluation are supported, and you can develop a basic AI off little more than the basic rules of your game. For many simple games, the resulting AI can be quite powerful, yet also easy to tune for players of various levels of skill.

## Requirements

GameMaker Studio 2022 / 2.3.7 or higher

If you use 2.3.0 - 2.3.6, please use [v1.0.0](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/GMTactician_MctsTree/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

## Installation

Get the asset package and the associated documentation from [the releases page](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/GMTactician_MctsTree/releases). Simply extract everything to your project, including the extension and the companion scripts. Once you do that, you may optionally change the configurations in `__MCTS_CONFIGS__` to suit your projects needs.
